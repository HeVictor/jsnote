# JSNote

JSNote is an application that uses a CLI to launch an interactive development environmnet for writing and document JavaScript code. It was built by following along with this Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/) by Stephen Grider.

It is implemented with React, TypeScript, Redux, Lerna, Express, CSS, and Node.JS. The entire application can be separated into three sub-projects: the CLI, the local Express API, and the React application.

It is deployed on npm under [debaser-jsnote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debaser-jsnote). _@debaser-jsnote_ itself corresponds to the CLI, while the child packages _local-api_ and _local-client_ correspond to the Express API and the React application, respectively.
